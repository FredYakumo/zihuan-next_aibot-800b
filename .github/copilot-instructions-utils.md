# Copilot Instructions: utils/

## Purpose
Utility functions for config loading and logging setup.

## Key Patterns
- `config_loader.py`: Loads YAML config, used at startup
- `logging_config.py`: Sets up logging, daily rotation
- Used by main and adapter modules

## How to Extend
- Add new utility functions as needed

## Example
- See `load_config` and `setup_logging` functions
